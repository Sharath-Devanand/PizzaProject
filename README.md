### Pizza Sales Analysis

## Project Background

I am a data analyst working at Pizza Stop, a local pizzeria based in Sheffield. I focus on extracting insights from the 2015 sales records containing 10K+ orders. Based on these insights, I am tasked with providing recommendations to the marketing, human resources, and finance departments.
